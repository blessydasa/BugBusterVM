# BugBusterVM

*A vulnerable machine for cybersecurity training and educational purposes.*

---

## Overview
BugBusterVM is a custom-built vulnerable machine designed to simulate SQL Injection vulnerabilities and hidden flag challenges. It provides a hands-on learning experience for cybersecurity enthusiasts and ethical hackers to practice penetration testing and vulnerability exploitation in a controlled environment.

---

## Features
- **SQL Injection Vulnerabilities**: Learn how to exploit insecure database queries.
- **Hidden Flags**: Three hidden flags are placed across the system to challenge users.
- **Educational Focus**: Perfect for beginners to gain practical skills in ethical hacking and vulnerability assessment.

---

## System Requirements
- **Hardware**: At least 2 GB RAM and 20 GB disk space.
- **Software**:
  - VirtualBox or any OVA-compatible virtualization tool.
  - Ubuntu Server (pre-configured in the OVA).
  - Tools for exploitation, such as SQLmap.

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Download the OVA File
Click the green **Code** button in this repository and select **Download ZIP** to get the OVA file.

### 2. Import the OVA File
1. Open VirtualBox.
2. Go to **File** > **Import Appliance**.
3. Select the downloaded OVA file and follow the import wizard.

### 3. Start the Machine
1. Boot up the virtual machine.
2. Access the web application hosted on the machine via the provided IP address.
3. Begin exploring and exploiting the vulnerabilities.

## Exploitation Guide

### SQL Injection Vulnerability
- The login page is vulnerable to SQL Injection.
- Use tools like SQLmap or manual techniques to bypass authentication and retrieve sensitive data.

### Hidden Flags
- **Flag 1**: Located in `/var/www/html/flag1.txt`.
- **Flag 2**: Located in `/root/flag2.txt`.
- **Flag 3**: Found in the database using SQL Injection.

## Setup Details

### Commands Used to Configure the Machine:
1. Install necessary packages:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install python3 python3-pip sqlite3
   ```
2. Create directories:
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /var/www/html
   sudo mkdir -p /root
   ```
3. Set permissions:
   ```bash
   sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html
   sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html
   ```
4. Run the vulnerable machine script:
   ```bash
   sudo python3 /home/anonymous/vulnerable_machine/vulnerable_machine.py
   ```

---

## Tools Used
- **SQLmap**: Automates SQL Injection exploitation.
- **Burp Suite**: For intercepting and manipulating requests.
- **Nmap**: For initial reconnaissance.
